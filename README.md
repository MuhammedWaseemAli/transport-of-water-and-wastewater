pumping main cost optimisation

This project is designed to help determine the optimal discharge rate that minimizes pumping costs and identify the appropriate pipe diameter to use. While some parts of the code are missing due to a device issue, the core functionality aims to assist in cost-efficient pipeline design. I plan to fill in the missing parts when I have the opportunity.r
